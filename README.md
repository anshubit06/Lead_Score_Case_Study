# Building a Linear Regression Model for a X Education company to solve their business problem. Idea is to filter out the prospective leads also called as hot leads and waste list (or non hot list). X Education company can increase conversion rate by calling only the people listed in hot list. Thereby result in better utilization of resources and leading to increase in profit as all the factors or variables contributing to profit will get identified.
